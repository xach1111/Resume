    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>As a school leaver who has recently completed A-levels, I am a highly motivated individual who thrives to succeed
        in providing the essential skills needed in the working environment. I have a background in programming,
        problem-solving and analytical thinking, which drives me to find efficient solutions to the tasks I have been
        given.</p>
    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>While I may not have any prior job experience, I have gained valuable knowledge and skills through my academic
        journey. As head boy at Shuttleworth College, I gained communication and leadership skills as we were required
        to mentor younger kids as they started their journey into high school. This taught me to honed my time
        management skills, prioritize tasks, and develop effective communication skills along-side gaining a strong work
        ethic and the ability to work well in a team setting.</p>
    <p>In addition to my role as head boy, I also took part in multiple academic challenges and competitions allowing me
        to adapt my abilities to quickly grasp new concepts and strengthen my passion for learning and gaining new
        skills. Although I may not have direct job experience, I am confident that the skills and knowledge I have
        acquired as a student will allow me to excel in any professional setting.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, I have spent most of my child hood living in Sri-Lanka for 7 years, from where, as a son of a
        Rotaractor, I helped with the Rotary club of Colombo fort carry out various community service projects such as
        providing rations for the flood relief, painting hospitals, and volunteering in elderly homes and orphanages,
        experiences which grew my understanding of different cultures, and helped me grow a passion for serving the
        community for the greater good.
